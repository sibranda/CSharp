### **About**
GIA is a C#.NET free app built for Intune that queries Intune and Entra ID via MS Graph.
Which has already reached more than 1,400 downloads!
This app aims to retrieve all active Intune item assignments.
The focus is to retrieve Assignments, so if you have an item (policy, settings, app) but it does not have an assignment, 
GIA will not report it.
You can also export the data to a CSV file if desired.
Please send me any comments you would like. This can help me fix bugs and create better solutions to help everyone.

### **Copyrights Warranty and Support**
This application is completely **free**. I created it for personal needs and my work needs, as it was extremely useful, I 
decided to share it with the community.
I created this app in my spare time which I don't have much of, like most people, so I can't provide support or 
guarantee that the app will work as expected in your environment. 
I'm just trying to do my part in the world.
You don't need to use this app; you don't need to be rude to me because you don't know me and don't trust me or 
think the app is malicious. Like I said: you have no obligation to use the app. If you want to give it a try, I hope it can 
be helpful to you and/or your clients.
And feel free to send me feedback as it helps everyone.
